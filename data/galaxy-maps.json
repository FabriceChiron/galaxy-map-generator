This interferes with scans and broadcasts, which has given rise to countless spacer stories of pirates lying in wait in Alingon's magnetosphere or crashed ships with untold fortunes stranded on the surface. In reality, any pirates would have a hard time locating prey amid all the interference and would live lives cut off from the rest of the galaxy because the magnetosphere kills extraplanetary communication.<br><br>Alingon's other natural features are a thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, spectacular dry ice formations, and xenon gas, which can be skimmed from the upper atmosphere and used in ion thrusters."

From Titan's surface, Saturn subtends an arc of 5.09 degrees and would appear 11.4 times larger in the sky than the Moon from Earth.<br><br>Titan is primarily composed of ice and rocky material. Much as with Venus before the Space Age, the dense opaque atmosphere prevented understanding of Titan's surface until the Cassini–Huygens mission in 2004 provided new information, including the discovery of liquid hydrocarbon lakes in Titan's polar regions. The geologically young surface is generally smooth, with few impact craters, although mountains and several possible cryovolcanoes have been found.<br><br>The atmosphere of Titan is largely nitrogen; minor components lead to the formation of methane and ethane clouds and nitrogen-rich organic smog. The climate—including wind and rain—creates surface features similar to those of Earth, such as dunes, rivers, lakes, seas (probably of liquid methane and ethane), and deltas, and is dominated by seasonal weather patterns as on Earth. With its liquids (both surface and subsurface) and robust nitrogen atmosphere, Titan's methane cycle is analogous to Earth's water cycle, at the much lower temperature of about 94 K (−179.2 °C; −290.5 °F)."

But when the Primarchs considered ceding the planet to robo-mining interests, the turian statesman Shastina Emperus ambitiously declared that she would start her own colony and double its population within five years.<br><br>This effort succeeded, largely due to the colonies' location in deserts with a minimal number of pest species. The image of Shastina's triumph in the frontier made for good political theater, and the turian population poured in. The planet's tropical belt still remains largely unexplored, as its aggressive organic life still wreaks havoc on turian biology. A \"house in an Invictus jungle\" is a modern turian phrase for an idea that seems like a good idea, but only to the one who came up with it.<br><br>Invictus' atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and oxygen, and its surface crust varies but has high concentrations of alumina and silver. Because it can support life easily, criminals from throughout the Terminus Systems hide out on Invictus.

Almost three hundred years ago, the quarians were driven from Rannoch by the geth, synthetic servants who gained sapience and rebelled against their creators. Although Rannoch is now largely uninhabited, the geth have acted as caretakers, working to repair the planet's ecology, restore ancient structures, and cultivate some farmland.\n<br><br>The Official Digital Toolset for Dungeons & DragonsVisit D&D BeyondFandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.Rannoch has no insect life. As a result, its pollinating plants evolved to rely on animals for propagation. This symbiosis between flora and fauna is responsible for the quarians' weakened immune systems, which made colonization of other planets extremely difficult after their exile from Rannoch. For many quarians, reclaiming their homeworld from the geth is a matter of both cultural and physiological necessity.\n<br><br>Other known lifeforms native to the quarian homeworld include the qorach, an animal analogous to a carnivorous bighorn sheep whose bellies are always covered in blue-green fern pollen and seed casings. The blind newborn offspring of a qorach is called ke'sed (alternatively kes'ed).\n<br><br>The lemek worm is a planarian analogue that can grow into new lemeks after being cut to pieces.

Strategically placed at the nexus of several primary and secondary mass relays, the colony quickly became a major hub for travel and commerce. The population grew fast: in 2165, only five years after its founding, it boasted a population of several million inhabitants, nearly half of them aliens. Due to the fact half of Elysium's population is non-human, requiring extra screening procedures, security there is very tight.\n<br><br>The Official Digital Toolset for Dungeons & DragonsVisit D&D BeyondFandom may earn an affiliate commission on sales made from links on this page.Its remote location in the Skyllian Verge was ideal for the retirement of Alliance hero Jon Grissom. He arrived on the colony in 2160 and five years later became involved in an investigation into the attack on an Alliance research station. In 2176, the Jon Grissom Academy space station was commissioned in Grissom's honor. Grissom himself always refused invitations and never visited the station. He remained on Elysium until his death in 2186, at the age of 75.\n<br><br>In 2176, the colony was attacked by a large force of mercenaries and pirates under the command of Elanos Haliat in what would become known as the Skyllian Blitz. The Alliance repulsed that attack, leading to significant increases in patrols throughout the Terminus Systems. One of the ships at Elysium was the frigate SSV Agincourt.
